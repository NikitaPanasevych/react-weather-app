You can check out real-time weather in any city in the world, just type city name and press "add city".

This project is built using React, tailwind CSS. At the process I've used react hooks(useState and useEffect) and JavaScript fetchAPi. It was quite interesting to work with API.

In the future I want to upgrade this project to check weather in different cities at the same time making a grid of cards with ability to remove using react hooks.
